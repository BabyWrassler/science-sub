This game is about a submarine on a mission to study ocean creatures. The player pilots the submarine, trying to catch animals to study. In the beginning, sharks will be too dangerous to catch - contacting one will end the game. The game tracks how many of each animal is caught. When enough of a particular species are caught, the submarine is transformed, mimicing features of the studied animal. This biomimicry is immunity while catching one shark. Catching a shark causes the loss of that particular modification but earns a badge (and extra points) for using the knowledge. The speed of all animals increases each time a shark is caught. There are nine animals besides the shark, and nine sharks must be caught to win the game. The story is that studying how the other animals defend themselves against sharks allows the submarine to use those techniques to catch sharks for study.

## Scoring

The scoring system is set up to reward players for studying all of the animals. To maximize score, the player should earn and use each immunity. Before using the last immunity, they could rack up more points by catching other animals. At present, there seems to be a bug that allows some immunities to be re-earned, but not others. This would change the scoring dynamic to some degree, making the ideal strategy unpredictable.

## Future plans

The aforementioned immunity re-earning bug should be squashed. Perhaps the current level could be shown on the screen.
