# Biomimicry ![Build status badge](https://github.com/babywrassler/science-sub/workflows/MakeCode/badge.svg)

This game is about a submarine on a mission to study ocean creatures. The player pilots the submarine, trying to catch animals to study. In the beginning, sharks will be too dangerous to catch - contacting one will end the game. The game tracks how many of each animal is caught. When enough of a particular species are caught, the submarine is transformed, mimicing some features of the studied animal. This biomimicry is immunity while catching one shark. Catching a shark causes the loss of that particular modification but earns a badge (and extra points) for using the knowledge. The speed of all animals increases each time a shark is caught. There are nine animals besides the shark, and nine sharks must be caught to win the game. The premise is that studying how the other animals defend themselves against sharks allows the submarine to use those techniques to catch sharks for study.

## Scoring

The scoring system is set up to reward players for studying all of the animals. To maximize score, the player should earn and use each immunity. Before using the last immunity, they could rack up more points by catching previously "studied" animals.

## Future plans

- Perhaps the current level could be shown on the screen? Maybe a better system of levels, beyond just faster animals and music?
- Better or shorter descriptions of biomimicry?
- Other objects to avoid, such as the occasional floating boulder. Boulders could damage the sub, but not end the game immediately.
