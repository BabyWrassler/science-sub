# science-sub ![Build status badge](https://github.com/babywrassler/science-sub/workflows/MakeCode/badge.svg)

This game is about a submarine on a mission to study ocean creatures. The player pilots the submarine, trying to catch animals to study. In the beginning, sharks will be too dangerous to catch - contacting one will end the game. The game tracks how many of each animal is caught. When 10 of a particular species are caught, the player earns a badge, which is effective tradable for immunity while catching one shark. Catching a shark causes the loss of that particular badge, but it can be earned back. There are nine animals besides the shark, and nine sharks must be caught to win the game. The story is that studying how the other animals defend themselves against sharks allows the submarine to use those techniques to catch sharks.

## Future plans
Eventually, I'd like to eliminate the immunity badge system, and instead display immunity by modifying the submarine's sprite image. In this scenario, perhaps only one immunity could be earned at a time. There may be some way to tie this into a level system, or perhaps it morphs into a mini boss system, and the final level has a different play technique. Just spitballing here.
